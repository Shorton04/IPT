There isnâ€™t a similar or equivalent button available in S/4HANA that functions the same way as the missing OK button. The popup we are using is part of the RE-FX (Real Estate) package, and its toolbar (PF-STATUS) is tightly integrated with RE-FX logic. If we attempt to customize or manually add a check/OK button, it would affect the standard RE-FX functionality currently used by the program.
