After lifting the current design to S/4HANA, there isn’t a similar or equivalent button available in S/4HANA that functions the same way as the missing OK button. The popup we are using is part of the RE-FX (Real Estate) package, and its toolbar (PF-STATUS) is tightly integrated with RE-FX logic. If we attempt to customize or manually add a check/OK button, it would affect the standard RE-FX functionality currently used by the program. If the OK or Check button is required, we would need to modify the standard class currently used in the design. Alternatively, if a new popup is needed, it would require a new design and corresponding functionality to support it.

Possible actions:
	1.	Communicate to the business that the new standard functionality in S/4HANA is through double-click instead of an OK button.
	2.	If the business prefers to retain a button-based approach, we can add a new Check/OK button, which would require changing the current standard class. If a different popup behavior is needed, we can develop a new popup with its own design and logic — this will require a new story/ticket as it is outside the current lift-and-shift scope.


Here’s my email

My lead want, dont use modify the standard class but rather use another standard or customize class that may give the requirements.

In 2. After the current standard class, put ‘and’ then next

And the this will require a new story etc. will be next sentence
