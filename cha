After lifting the current design to S/4HANA, the class previously used was moved from the RE-FX (Real Estate) package. Because of this, the standard button functionalities and PF-STATUS are no longer working as they did before.

If the OK or Check button is required, we would need to modify the standard class currently used in the design. Alternatively, if a new popup is needed, it would require a new design and corresponding functionality to support it.

Possible actions:
	1.	Communicate to the business that the new standard functionality in S/4HANA is through double-click instead of an OK button.
	2.	If the business prefers to retain a button-based approach, we can add a new Check/OK button, which would require changing the current standard class.
	3.	If a different popup behavior is needed, we can develop a new popup with its own design and logic â€” this will require a new story/ticket as it is outside the current lift-and-shift scope.

For reference, below is the knowledge base article for RE-FX and the related package details from T1Y and T30.
