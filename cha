The Object and Posting amounts differ (120 vs 100) because the system performed currency conversion in the opposite direction or at a different exchange rate.
The Object amount reflects the WBS currency value, while the Posting amount reflects the company code currency after conversion.
Once the conversion direction or exchange rate alignment is corrected, both values will align proportionally.
