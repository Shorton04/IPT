After lifting the current design to S/4HANA, there isnâ€™t a similar or equivalent button available in S/4HANA that functions the same way as the missing OK button. The popup we are using is part of the RE-FX (Real Estate) package, and its toolbar (PF-STATUS) is tightly integrated with RE-FX logic. If we attempt to customize or manually add a check/OK button, it would affect the standard RE-FX functionality currently used by the program.

If the OK or Check button is required, we would need to use another standard or a custom class that can fulfill the requirement. Alternatively, if a new popup is needed, it would require a new design and corresponding functionality to support it.

Possible actions:
	1.	Communicate to the business that the new standard functionality in S/4HANA is through double-click instead of an OK button.
	2.	If the business prefers to retain a button-based approach, we can add a new Check/OK button using another standard or custom class, and this will require a new story/ticket, as it is outside the current lift-and-shift scope.
